[17:07] Is it a good idea to write short blog post to hugo? I don't post twitter, I don't want discussion on my post. I want to post the short post from my iPhone(Shortcut seems a good tool for this)

[17:08] Next thing todo is format the date and time displaying, how do I keep the post, plain text?

[17:08] How about integration with Drafts? or Drafts as backend?

[17:09] I dont want to edit update time and do the committment each time.

[17:09] Maybe Hugo is not the best option for my requirement, how about a Google Cloud Run app with Firebase as backend? No it will be slow for a static purpose blog website.

[23:15] Verified my domain on Atlassian, but seems still can not use custom domain for my site.
